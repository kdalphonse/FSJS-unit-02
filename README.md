 Techdegree proejct 2 (pagination)

Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree project 2.

The objective of this project was to add pagination to a web page that has a list of 'students', displaying 10 students to a page.

By using Unobtrusive JavaScript (and Progressive Enhancement in particular), the page should 'work' with or without javascript enabled.

I am shooting for 'Exceeds Excpectations' .
